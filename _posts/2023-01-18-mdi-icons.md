If you are using [MDI font](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/font) you may also know 
[official site](https://materialdesignicons.com/) to pick icon names from. But it shows only one (now it is v6.9.96) version of `@mdi/font` and there is no option to change it. There is also
[a page on pictogrammers.com](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) contains only one (now it is v7.1.96) version too.

Icons may appear differently between versions (check `mdi-folder-lock`, it changed between v6.5 and v7.1).
And, of course, new versions contain more icons than old. That's why the version is important. If MDI font version in your
project differs from the version on site - the information on site may be irrelevant to you.

There is a good page on [pictogrammers.github.io](https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/7.2.96/) that shows icons of
the specific version of library.

To choose version, edit URL as follows:

```js
`https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/${version}/`
```

where `${version}` is `@mdi/font` package version. For example:
[2.0.46](https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/2.0.46/), 
[6.5.95](https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/6.5.95/), 
[7.1.96](https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/7.1.96/) 

Unfortunately, it doesn't have a search, but you can use your built-in browser Find Tool.
